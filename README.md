# Color Picker
Color Picker app developed for **Android** and **iOS** using .**NET MAUI XAML** for **Front-End** and **C#** for **Back-End**.


## App Purpose:
This app was created intended to be used to learn more about **.NET XAML Framework and C#**.

I'm learning more about this language for mobile software development and enhance my **Front-End** and **Code-Visual Pages** *(Instead of relying only on apps like Figma, low code platforms, Windows Forms or even Unity's UI System)*.

## How It Works:
Each slide controls one color from **RGB** - Varying from **0** to **255**.<br>
The button has the **HEX Code** and when clicked, it copies the code into clipboard.
